# Dynamic Programming Algorithm
Certainly! Below is a documentation template for a Dynamic Programming algorithm, along with a Java example of solving the classic problem of finding the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

## Dynamic Programming Algorithm Documentation

### 1. Algorithm Overview

#### 1.1 Description

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems in a table to avoid redundant computations.

#### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of the algorithm is to improve efficiency by storing and reusing solutions to subproblems, thereby reducing the overall time complexity.

### 2. Pseudocode

Provide pseudocode that outlines the steps of the Dynamic Programming algorithm.

```plaintext
procedure DynamicProgramming(problem):
    create a table to store solutions to subproblems
    
    for each subproblem in the problem:
        if subproblem has not been solved:
            solve subproblem
            store solution in the table
    
    return the solution to the original problem
```

### 3. Time Complexity

Describe the time complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the time complexity is influenced by the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n) for solving the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

### 4. Space Complexity

Describe the space complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the space complexity scales with the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n) for storing solutions to subproblems in the Fibonacci example.

### 5. Implementation

Provide a sample implementation of a Dynamic Programming algorithm in Java. For example, the following code demonstrates solving the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FibonacciDynamicProgramming {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        int result = fibonacciDP(n);
        System.out.println("Fibonacci(" + n + ") = " + result);
    }

    // Dynamic Programming approach to find the nth Fibonacci number
    private static int fibonacciDP(int n) {
        int[] dpTable = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dpTable, -1);
        return fibonacciMemoization(n, dpTable);
    }

    private static int fibonacciMemoization(int n, int[] dpTable) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }

        if (dpTable[n] != -1) {
            return dpTable[n];
        }

        dpTable[n] = fibonacciMemoization(n - 1, dpTable) + fibonacciMemoization(n - 2, dpTable);
        return dpTable[n];
    }
}
```

### 6. Use Cases

Describe scenarios or types of problems for which the Dynamic Programming algorithm is suitable.

Example:
- Optimization problems, such as the knapsack problem, shortest path problems.

### 7. Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 7.1 Advantages

- Reduces time complexity by avoiding redundant computations.
- Suitable for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

#### 7.2 Disadvantages

- Requires additional memory for storing solutions to subproblems.
- Not suitable for all types of problems.

### 8. Examples

Provide examples of other problems that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

Example:
- Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Edit Distance.

### 9. References

Include any references or sources that were consulted during the algorithm design and documentation process.

### 10. Author

Include information about the person or team that developed the algorithm and wrote the documentation.
