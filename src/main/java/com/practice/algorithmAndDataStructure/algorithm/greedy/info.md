# Greedy Algorithm
Certainly! Here's a documentation template for a Greedy Algorithm, along with a Java example of solving the classic problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

## Greedy Algorithm Documentation

### 1. Algorithm Overview

#### 1.1 Description

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. The algorithm makes the best choice at each step without considering the overall future consequences.

#### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of the algorithm is to find an approximate solution to an optimization problem by making a series of locally optimal choices.

### 2. Pseudocode

Provide pseudocode that outlines the steps of the Greedy Algorithm.

```plaintext
procedure GreedyAlgorithm(problem):
    initialize an empty solution
    while the solution is not complete:
        make the best locally optimal choice
        update the solution
    return the solution
```

### 3. Time Complexity

Describe the time complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the time complexity is influenced by the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n log n) for sorting in a Greedy Algorithm.

### 4. Space Complexity

Describe the space complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the space complexity scales with the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(1) for constant space if no additional data structures are used.

### 5. Implementation

Provide a sample implementation of a Greedy Algorithm in Java. For example, the following code demonstrates solving the minimum coin change problem.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class GreedyCoinChange {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] coins = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000};
        int amount = 93;

        int[] result = getMinCoins(coins, amount);
        System.out.println("Minimum coins needed: " + Arrays.toString(result));
    }

    // Greedy Algorithm for minimum coin change problem
    private static int[] getMinCoins(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int n = coins.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, 0);

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (amount >= coins[i]) {
                result[i]++;
                amount -= coins[i];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### 6. Use Cases

Describe scenarios or types of problems for which the Greedy Algorithm is suitable.

Example:
- Fractional Knapsack Problem, Huffman Coding.

### 7. Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 7.1 Advantages

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Provides quick solutions for certain types of problems.

#### 7.2 Disadvantages

- May not always guarantee an optimal solution.
- Not suitable for all types of problems.

### 8. Examples

Provide examples of other problems that can be solved using Greedy Algorithms.

Example:
- Job Sequencing with Deadlines, Prim's and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms.

### 9. References

Include any references or sources that were consulted during the algorithm design and documentation process.

### 10. Author

Include information about the person or team that developed the algorithm and wrote the documentation.
