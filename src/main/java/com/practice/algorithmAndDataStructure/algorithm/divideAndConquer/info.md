# Divide And Conquer Algorithm
Certainly! Here's a documentation template for a Divide and Conquer algorithm, along with a Java example of the Merge Sort algorithm, which is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

## Divide and Conquer Algorithm Documentation

### 1. Algorithm Overview

#### 1.1 Description

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves the subproblems independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem.

#### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of the algorithm is to simplify complex problems by dividing them into manageable subproblems and solving each subproblem efficiently.

### 2. Pseudocode

Provide pseudocode that outlines the steps of the Divide and Conquer algorithm.

```plaintext
procedure DivideAndConquer(problem):
    if problem is small enough:
        solve problem directly
    else:
        divide problem into subproblems
        conquer each subproblem recursively
        combine solutions of subproblems
```

### 3. Time Complexity

Describe the time complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the time complexity is influenced by the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n log n) for Merge Sort, where n is the size of the input.

### 4. Space Complexity

Describe the space complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the space complexity scales with the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n) for Merge Sort due to the auxiliary space required for merging.

### 5. Implementation

Provide a sample implementation of a Divide and Conquer algorithm in Java. For example, the following code demonstrates the Merge Sort algorithm.

```java
public class MergeSort {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(array));

        mergeSort(array, 0, array.length - 1);

        System.out.println("Sorted Array: " + Arrays.toString(array));
    }

    // Merge Sort algorithm implementation
    private static void mergeSort(int[] array, int left, int right) {
        if (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Divide the array into two halves and sort each half
            mergeSort(array, left, mid);
            mergeSort(array, mid + 1, right);

            // Merge the sorted halves
            merge(array, left, mid, right);
        }
    }

    private static void merge(int[] array, int left, int mid, int right) {
        int n1 = mid - left + 1;
        int n2 = right - mid;

        // Create temporary arrays
        int[] leftArray = new int[n1];
        int[] rightArray = new int[n2];

        // Copy data to temporary arrays
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
            leftArray[i] = array[left + i];
        for (int j = 0; j < n2; ++j)
            rightArray[j] = array[mid + 1 + j];

        // Merge the temporary arrays

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int k = left;
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (leftArray[i] <= rightArray[j]) {
                array[k] = leftArray[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                array[k] = rightArray[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }

        // Copy remaining elements of leftArray[], if any
        while (i < n1) {
            array[k] = leftArray[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }

        // Copy remaining elements of rightArray[], if any
        while (j < n2) {
            array[k] = rightArray[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Use Cases

Describe scenarios or types of problems for which the Divide and Conquer algorithm is suitable.

Example:
