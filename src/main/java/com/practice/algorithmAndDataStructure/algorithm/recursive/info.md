# Recursion Algorithm
Certainly! Below is a documentation template for a Recursive Algorithm, along with a Java example of solving the classic problem of calculating the factorial of a number using recursion.

## Recursive Algorithm Documentation

### 1. Algorithm Overview

#### 1.1 Description

A recursive algorithm is a problem-solving approach that solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem, and combining their solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem.

#### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of the algorithm is to provide a clear and concise way of solving problems that can be naturally divided into smaller, similar subproblems.

### 2. Pseudocode

Provide pseudocode that outlines the steps of the Recursive Algorithm.

```plaintext
procedure RecursiveAlgorithm(problem):
    if problem is small enough:
        solve problem directly
    else:
        divide problem into smaller subproblems
        solve each subproblem recursively
        combine solutions of subproblems to solve the original problem
```

### 3. Time Complexity

Describe the time complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the time complexity grows with the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(2^n) for a naive recursive approach to certain problems, but it can be improved with memoization or dynamic programming.

### 4. Space Complexity

Describe the space complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation. Discuss how the space complexity scales with the size of the problem.

Example:
- O(n) for the depth of the recursion stack, but it depends on the specific problem and optimizations.

### 5. Implementation

Provide a sample implementation of a Recursive Algorithm in Java. For example, the following code demonstrates calculating the factorial of a number using recursion:

```java
public class RecursiveFactorial {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5;
        long result = factorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " = " + result);
    }

    // Recursive algorithm to calculate factorial
    private static long factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Use Cases

Describe scenarios or types of problems for which the Recursive Algorithm is suitable.

Example:
- Traversing tree structures, calculating Fibonacci sequence, solving problems with optimal substructure.

### 7. Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 7.1 Advantages

- Clear and intuitive solution for certain types of problems.
- Elegant representation of certain algorithms.

#### 7.2 Disadvantages

- May lead to inefficient solutions for large problems.
- Risk of stack overflow for deep recursion.

### 8. Examples

Provide examples of other problems that can be solved using Recursive Algorithms.

Example:
- Tower of Hanoi problem, binary tree traversals, quicksort algorithm.

### 9. References

Include any references or sources that were consulted during the algorithm design and documentation process.

### 10. Author

Include information about the person or team that developed the algorithm and wrote the documentation.
